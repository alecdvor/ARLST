Conversation with Gemini

I have attached a question pool for the extra class amateur radio exam. Can you please provide me with js files containing the question and answers in a format similar to the attached file. The pool includes questions E1A01 through E0A12. images are required for certain questions in sections E5, E6, E7, and E9. These images are figures E5-1, E6-1, E6-2, E6-3, E7-1, E7-2, E7-3, E9-1, E9-2, and E9-3. Please provide me with question data js files for each of the chapters one at a time starting with chapter E3.
